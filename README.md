# Blackjack-on-python
A game of blackjack using Python and Tkinter-GUI library. This project was made by me and my friend (https://github.com/P1ker1). This was the first bigger project for me and I mainly took care of the functionality of the game itself and my friend mainly implemented the graphics interface of the program.
